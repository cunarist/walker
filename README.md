![](image/wasd-screen.png)

It is recommended to make middle mouse button activate the macro `WASD` in Rhino options.

1. Use the command `WASD`.
1. Move with `W` `A` `S` `D` `Q` `E` keys. Hold down `shift` to move faster as if you are running. Scroll to change the speed.
1. Press `escape` or left mouse button or right mouse button to stop the behaviour and get back to the usual Rhinoceros 3D Navigation

# Extras

The command `Screenshot` is an extra command, which you can use from either the command line directly or while in WASD mode trough `F12`.
When the command is started from the command line you can choose betreen different options. These options will be saved and can therefore be used during the WASD mode as well.
